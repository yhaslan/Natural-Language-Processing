    "# Text Summarization\n",
    "\n",
    "You can actually categorize the methods for summarizing a text. These categories are:\n",
    "- Extractive vs. Abstractive\n",
    "- Extractive summaries are summaries built out of document itself, it consists of text taken from the original document, it's a subset\n",
    "- Abstractive summaries can contain new sequences of texts not necessarily taken from the input\n",
    "- the former are much easier to generate than latter: you'll just need to identify relevant parts with the code vs you need to develop an understanding of the input & convert that understanding into a text\n",
    "- This section of the course will focus on extractive summaries\n",
    "- Abstractive summaries more suited to deep learning such as seq2seq, transformers\n",
    "\n",
    "### We'll look at two methods:\n",
    "- Method 1: requires only knowledge of vector based methods (Tfidf)\n",
    "- Method 2: more complex, based on Google's Page Rank, requires a bit more knowledge on prob and algebra (specifically Markov chains?) different from probability used earlier\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using Vectors\n",
    "- we'll use Tfidf\n",
    "- split the document into sentences\n",
    "- score each sentecne\n",
    "- rank sentences by those scores\n",
    "- our summary will simply be the top scoring sentences\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sentence Splitting & TF-IDF\n",
    "- called sentence tokenization can be done with nltk:\n",
    "nltk.sent_tokenize(text)\n",
    "- then treat each as if they were a separate document\n",
    "- build TF-idf matrix\n",
    "- previously the rows were documents, now they're sentences, columns are still terms\n",
    "#### Scoring each sentence:\n",
    "- simplest way: average of non-zero values in each sentence\n",
    "- yani feature sayısına değil, non-zero olan term sayısına böl\n",
    "- why does it work? remember each component of tfidf vector tells us how often a specific term appears\n",
    "- so if a word appears in many sentences tfidf will shrink\n",
    "- unimpotant words thşs way will have a smaller value\n",
    "- why mean not sum? sum would be biased towards larger sentences\n",
    "#### What to do with scores?\n",
    "- idea: sort scores, pick the sentences with highest scores\n",
    "- multiple ways try and choose best\n",
    "- simplest : take top N sentences\n",
    "- also simple: top N words or top N characters if you have limt , ex : if you're building a search engine there is limited space for you to show your result summary\n",
    "- or top X% of sentences words\n",
    "- or you may define a theshold score, ex: average score, but can be too much\n",
    "- maybe threshold = average score * factor\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise Prompt\n",
    "- bbc dataset again\n",
    "- try it on multiple articles\n",
    "- spplit article into sentences\n",
    "- Tfidf matrix from sentences\n",
    "- score each sentence by takşng average\n",
    "- sort each sentence by score\n",
    "- filter out "
